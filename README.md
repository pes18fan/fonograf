# fonograf

Basic music player in C++.

Uses the [miniaudio](https://github.com/mackron/miniaudio) library for audio
decoding.

# building

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pes18fan/fonograf.git
```

Now, install the required libraries (currently, just miniaudio) and build. If 
on Linux or macOS:

```bash
make deps
```

If on Windows, run `build.bat`.

Enjoy!
